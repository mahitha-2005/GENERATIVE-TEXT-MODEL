## Tools & Libraries Used:
Hugging Face Transformers: For model loading and inference.

PyTorch (torch): Backend to run the model computations.

Model: GPT-2 (a transformer-based language model).

## Model & Tokenizer Loading:

Uses the Hugging Face transformers library to load GPT-2 (GPT2LMHeadModel and GPT2Tokenizer).

GPT-2 is a pre-trained transformer model trained on a large corpus of English text.

User Prompt:

The user provides a topic (e.g., “Artificial intelligence is transforming the future”).

## Text Generation:

The prompt is tokenized and fed into the GPT-2 model.

The model generates a sequence of text up to a specified length.

Sampling techniques like top-k, top-p, and temperature control randomness and diversity in output.

## OUTPUT:

Artificial intelligence is transforming the future in unprecedented ways. From autonomous vehicles to advanced medical diagnostics, AI is becoming an integral part of daily life. Its ability to process vast amounts of data and learn from it is revolutionizing industries, improving efficiency, and opening up new frontiers in research and innovation. As technology continues to evolve, ethical considerations and responsible development will play a critical role in shaping the future of AI.
